                <h2>Upcoming MetroConnect Projects: Expanding Pune's Transit Future</h2>
                <p>MetroConnect is constantly expanding to improve the service experience for our passengers. Several exciting 
                    projects are currently in progress to extend the metro lines and make travel even more convenient across Pune 
                    and Pimpri Chinchwad.
                    The upcoming projects include extensions to the existing metro lines, such as the PCMC to Nigdi extension on Line 1 
                    and the Swargate to Katraj extension. These expansions will connect more neighborhoods, reduce travel time, and make 
                    metro journeys smoother and more efficient.
                    With modern, safe, and comfortable metro stations under development, these projects aim to further enhance the lifestyle 
                    and convenience of our passengers. Stay updated with us as we continue to grow our services and provide a better metro 
                    experience for all.</p>
